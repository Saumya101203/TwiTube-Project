# Twitube - Subscription-Based Video Sharing Platform

Twitube is a full-stack, subscription-based video sharing platform developed using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Mongoose for data schema management. The platform allows users to upload and share videos, interact with content through likes and subscriptions, and personalize their channels with avatars and custom posts.

## Features

- **Like and Subscribe**: Users can like videos and subscribe to channels. The platform displays the total number of views on each video.
- **Tweets**: Users can post tweets visible to anyone on their channel, enabling community engagement and real-time updates.
- **Customizable Avatars**: Users can personalize their channels by setting a custom avatar image.
- **Subscriptions**: A dedicated "subscriptions" tab where users can view and interact with the latest content from the channels they are subscribed to.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose, Cloudinary(for videos and file storing)
